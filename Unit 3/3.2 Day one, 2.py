# Description: A program that multiplies a given
# integer by three until it exceeds 10000.
# Test cases: I used the numbers 7, and 30.

# Input: gets users input for number.
num = int(input("please enter a number above 0 and under 10000: "))

# Process: Calculates if X is less than 10000 and if so multiplies X by 3.
while (x < 10000):
    num *= 3
    
# Process: Outputs the numbers until exceeding 10000.
    print(num)
